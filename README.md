# Movie Bot

The bot helps create a list of 10 movie requests by users, so users can later vote and select the movie with the most votes; all using 
the bot's commands.

## Setup
Remember to replace the *TOKEN ID* and *CLIENT ID* with your own. This is assuming you have at least a Discord server to use this on. 
```
bundle install
ruby bot.rb

```
